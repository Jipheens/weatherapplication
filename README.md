### Technology Used

---

- Used Visual Studio Code editor to write the _**HTML**_, _**CSS**_ and _**Javascript**_ used to create the quiz board website.

- **HTML** - HTML was used to create the structure and foundation of the landing page.

- **CSS** - used css to style the website to look appealing to the user.

- **Javascript** - Used Javascript to create functions, conditions and loops to manipulate items on the webpage. Especially added event listeners that can listen and trigger a function when features like form submit, mouseover and button are triggered.

- Employed the help of [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp) to be able to add and remove class attributes. With the help of [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9709209/html-select-only-one-checkbox-in-a-group) I was able to add the function to allow only one answer to be selcted at a time.

- Used [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub) to get the [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) API keys that enabled me to fetch and use their APIs to create the weather app
